   abstract = {I propose a new equation to estimate the normal at a vertex of a polygonal approximation to a smooth surface, as a weighted sum of the normals to the facets surrounding the vertex. It accounts for the difference in size of these facets by assigning larger weights for smaller facets. When tested on random cubic polynomial surfaces, it is superior to other popular weighting methods.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a unified and consistent set of flexible tools to approximate important geometric attributes, including normal vectors and curvatures on arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a consistent derivation of these first and second order differential properties using averaging Voronoi cells and the mixed Finite-Element/Finite-Volume method, and compare them to existing formulations. Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing, enhancement , and quality checking, and show results of denoising in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},

   abstract = {The computation of curvature and other differential properties of surfaces is essential for many techniques in analysis and rendering. We present a finite-differences approach for estimating curvatures on irregular triangle meshes that may be thought of as an extension of a common method for estimating per-vertex normals. The technique is efficient in space and time, and results in significantly fewer outlier estimates while more broadly offering accuracy comparable to existing methods. It generalizes naturally to computing derivatives of curvature and higher-order surface differentials.},
